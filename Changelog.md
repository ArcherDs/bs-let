# 0.1.16

- Sorry for the mess, but the last couple of changes broke the PPX entirely, at least for non-Windows people. This change renames the executable from `ppx.exe` to just `ppx` like it was before.
- Hey Windows people, does this break you? Please let us know.

# 0.1.15

- Fixed Windows support thanks to @bikallem!

# 0.1.14

- Changed the build process to support windows and use Github Actions (thank you @baransu)!
